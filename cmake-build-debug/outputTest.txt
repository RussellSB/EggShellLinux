Hey russellsb! This source command seems to be working pretty well right? 
You know what? I'm going to have some fun 
First I'll print all your variables! 

EXITCODE=0

Ooo, interesting $CWD I'll take you up to the root directory now 
it's now: /mnt/1EACD264ACD235CD/Artificial Intellige (BSc.)/2nd Semester/OS/Assignment 
Great now that's happened, I'll set your $PROMPT to: 
INSANELY_LEGIT_PROMPT_:)_==>_ 
If you'd like to reset the prompt use chdir 
Russell made it so putting chdir on its own sets it back to the initial directory and it affects the prompt!
